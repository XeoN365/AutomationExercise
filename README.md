# Automation Exercise Test Cases
I've attempted to create the test cases from [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/).

# How to run
I've tried to make it as painless as possible, firstly ensure you have installed python. This code was written using```Python 3.11```.<br>
Let's run the installation of necessary libraries.<br>
You can do that by opening terminal in the main folder and run```py -m pip install -r requirements.txt```to install selenium as well as pytest.<br>
Once you have everything installed just run```pytest```in the main folder and it will execute each test one after another.
